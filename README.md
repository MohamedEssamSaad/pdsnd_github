### Project Title
BikeShare Data

### Description
This Python 3 script is written to explore data related to bike share systems for Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It imports data from csv files and computes descriptive statistics from the data. It is run from the terminal (or from Jupyter notebooks).

### Files used
The datasets used for this script contain bike share data for the first six months of 2017. You can access the original data files here Chicago, New York City, Washington. Some data wrangling, to reduce columns and reformat, has been performed to condense these files to the core six columns used in this project. This makes the analysis and the evaluation in this project more straightforward.

### Credits
The datetime module contains many useful methods for handling date filtering and extraction: strftime converts date objects into readable strings: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/datetime/strftime strptime takes strings and converts them into date objects that Python can understand: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/datetime/strptime strf & strp time: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior This stackoverflow answer explains perfectly how to extract day, month, year from a Date: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21954197/which-is-the-fastest-way-to-extract-day-month-and-year-from-a-given-date/21954923#21954923
