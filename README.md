The datetime module contains many useful methods for handling date filtering and extraction: strftime converts date objects into readable strings: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/datetime/strftime 

strptime takes strings and converts them into date objects that Python can understand: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/datetime/strptime strf & strp time: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior
